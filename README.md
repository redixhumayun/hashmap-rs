## Running This Project

This project is a tool to help understand cache aware data structures better. You can build a hash map implementation that follows a specific API and then profile it using a simple script.

To run the script, you simply need to execute `bash profiling.sh load_results`. `load_results` is an example workload here, and there are a bunch of others. Feel free to write your own workloads and add your own implementations of hashmaps.

If you run into any access issues because of the script, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/redixhumayun/learnings/issues/9) to get past them.
